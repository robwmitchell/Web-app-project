## What Was Fixed and Deployed

### 🔧 SendGrid Timeline Day Indicators Issue - FULLY RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Day indicators not highlighting events from past 7 days
- **Root Cause**: Timezone issues in date comparison logic  
- **Solution**: Implemented ISO string date comparison for reliable day matching
- **Result**: July 11th events and other recent incidents now properly highlighted

### 🎯 SendGrid Severity Detection Issue - NEWLY FIXED
- **Problem**: Events showing as green (operational) when there were actual issues
- **Root Cause**: Overly aggressive "resolved" logic + insufficient keyword detection
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed logic that marked resolved issues as operational
  - Enhanced keyword detection for "experiencing issues", "degraded", "experiencing", etc.
  - Incidents now properly color-coded based on actual severity
- **Result**: July 11th incidents now show as orange/red (major/minor) instead of green
