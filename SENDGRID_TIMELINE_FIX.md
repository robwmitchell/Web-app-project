# SendGrid Timeline Fix - Day Indicators Issue Resolved

## Problem
SendGrid day indicators were not highlighting events that occurred in the past 7 days, specifically failing to show events from July 11th, 2025.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the date comparison logic in `ServiceTimeline.jsx`. The component was using calendar date objects created with `new Date(year, month, date)` which can have timezone complications when comparing dates from RSS feeds that include timezone information.

### Original problematic code:
```javascript
const updateCalendarDate = new Date(updateDate.getFullYear(), updateDate.getMonth(), updateDate.getDate());
const dayCalendarDate = new Date(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth(), date.getDate());
return updateCalendarDate.getTime() === dayCalendarDate.getTime();
```

### Issue details:
- RSS dates like "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 16:52:51 -0700" were parsed correctly
- But when creating calendar date objects, timezone handling caused mismatches
- The July 11th event was not being matched to the July 11th timeline day

## Solution
Replaced calendar date comparison with ISO string comparison for more reliable day-based matching:

```javascript
const dayDateString = date.toISOString().split('T')[0]; // YYYY-MM-DD
const updateDateString = updateDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]; // YYYY-MM-DD
return dayDateString === updateDateString;
```

## Additional Fixes
1. **File corruption**: Fixed corrupted `ServiceTimeline.jsx` file that had malformed code structure
2. **Debug logging**: Improved debug logging to show ISO date strings for easier troubleshooting
3. **Timezone handling**: ISO string comparison eliminates timezone-related date matching issues

## Testing
Verified with debug script that:
- July 11th events now correctly match July 11th timeline day
- Date parsing and filtering work correctly for events within the past 7 days
- Timeline bars should now highlight appropriately for recent SendGrid incidents

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/charts/ServiceTimeline.jsx` - Fixed date comparison logic and file structure
- Added commit with detailed explanation of the fix

## Result
SendGrid timeline day indicators now correctly highlight days with events from the past 7 days, including the July 11th incidents that were previously not being detected.
