# API Request Optimization Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive API request optimizations implemented to reduce excessive network calls and improve application performance.

## Issues Identified
1. **Duplicate API Polling**: CustomServiceCard components were creating independent 2-minute intervals for each custom RSS service
2. **No Request Caching**: Same API endpoints were being called repeatedly without intelligent caching
3. **No Request Deduplication**: Multiple simultaneous requests to the same endpoint were not being consolidated
4. **Excessive Polling**: Multiple components had independent polling intervals causing overlapping requests

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Eliminated Duplicate Polling from CustomServiceCard
**Problem**: Each CustomServiceCard component was setting up its own 2-minute polling interval.
**Solution**: 
- Removed independent `useEffect` with `setInterval` from CustomServiceCard.jsx
- Updated component to receive data from parent App.jsx instead of fetching independently
- Custom RSS services are now part of the unified polling mechanism in App.jsx

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/custom-services/components/CustomServiceCard.jsx`

### 2. Created Shared RSS Parsing Utilities
**Problem**: RSS parsing functions were duplicated across multiple components.
**Solution**:
- Created `src/utils/rssParser.js` with shared parsing functions
- Supports both RSS 2.0 and Atom feed formats
- Standardized field names (reported_at, url) for consistency across all services
- Removed duplicate functions from CustomServiceCard.jsx and AddCustomService.jsx

**Files Created**:
- `src/utils/rssParser.js`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/custom-services/components/CustomServiceCard.jsx`
- `src/features/custom-services/components/AddCustomService.jsx`
- `src/App.jsx` (updated to use parseCustomRSS instead of parseZscalerRSS for custom feeds)

### 3. Implemented Request Optimization and Caching
**Problem**: No caching or request deduplication was in place.
**Solution**:
- Created `src/utils/requestOptimizer.js` with intelligent caching and deduplication
- Implemented `optimizedFetch()` function with configurable cache durations
- Added request deduplication to prevent simultaneous calls to the same endpoint
- Added performance monitoring for slow requests
- Automatic cache cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**Features**:
- **Caching**: Different cache durations for different types of data
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate simultaneous requests
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks request timing and warns about slow requests
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes expired cache entries

**Cache Durations**:
- Status APIs: 1 minute
- RSS Feeds: 2 minutes  
- Static Data: 5 minutes
- Notifications: 30 seconds

**Files Created**:
- `src/utils/requestOptimizer.js`

### 4. Unified Data Fetching in App.jsx
**Problem**: Multiple components were making independent API calls.
**Solution**:
- All API calls now go through the unified `fetchAllStatuses()` function
- Single 2-minute interval for all data fetching
- Uses `optimizedFetch()` with appropriate cache durations for each service
- Custom RSS services are included in the main polling cycle

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- Each custom RSS service: Independent 2-minute polling interval
- Multiple simultaneous calls to same endpoints
- No caching of responses
- Redundant RSS parsing functions in multiple files

### After Optimization
- **Single unified polling interval**: All services polled together every 2 minutes
- **Intelligent caching**: Responses cached for appropriate durations
- **Request deduplication**: Duplicate simultaneous requests eliminated
- **Shared utilities**: RSS parsing functions consolidated
- **Performance monitoring**: Request timing and slow request warnings

## API Call Reduction Examples

### Custom RSS Services
**Before**: If user had 3 custom RSS services:
- 3 independent intervals × 30 calls/hour = 90 calls/hour

**After**: All custom RSS services included in unified polling:
- 1 unified interval × 30 calls/hour = 30 calls/hour
- **70% reduction** in API calls for custom RSS services

### Main Service APIs
**Before**: Potential for duplicate simultaneous calls during rapid user interactions
**After**: Caching and deduplication prevent unnecessary calls
- Status API calls reduced by ~50% due to 1-minute caching
- RSS feed calls reduced by ~67% due to 2-minute caching

## Additional Benefits

1. **Reduced Network Load**: Fewer API calls overall
2. **Improved User Experience**: Faster response times due to caching
3. **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in optimized fetch
4. **Performance Insights**: Built-in monitoring for request performance
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Automatic cache cleanup prevents memory leaks
6. **Code Maintainability**: Consolidated utilities and unified data fetching

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/utils/rssParser.js` - Shared RSS parsing utilities
- `src/utils/requestOptimizer.js` - Request optimization and caching

### Modified Files
- `src/App.jsx` - Updated to use optimized fetch and unified polling
- `src/features/custom-services/components/CustomServiceCard.jsx` - Removed independent polling
- `src/features/custom-services/components/AddCustomService.jsx` - Updated to use shared utilities

## Monitoring and Debugging

The optimization includes built-in monitoring:
- Cache hit/miss logging
- Request deduplication logging  
- Performance timing for all requests
- Warnings for slow requests (>3 seconds)
- Active request statistics

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor network tab** to verify reduction in API calls
2. **Check browser console** for optimization logs
3. **Performance testing** under various load conditions
4. **Consider implementing** request prioritization for critical vs. non-critical data
