// Performance optimization recommendations for Stack Status IO

## Current Analysis Results:

### Bundle Size Analysis:
- **JavaScript**: 291.13 kB (84.45 kB gzipped) ✅ Good
- **CSS**: 100.78 kB (17.99 kB gzipped) ✅ Good  
- **Large Image**: stackstatus1.png (1.4MB) ⚠️ Needs optimization

### System Resource Issues Found:

#### 1. **Component Re-renders** (HIGH IMPACT)
- No React.memo usage - components re-render unnecessarily
- Heavy components like service cards re-render on every state update

#### 2. **API Polling Overhead** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
- Main app: 2-minute intervals ✅ Reasonable
- Custom services: 5-minute intervals ✅ Reasonable
- Alert ticker: 30-second intervals ⚠️ Could be optimized
- Multiple simultaneous intervals running

#### 3. **Code Splitting** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
- Everything loads upfront
- Heavy components not lazy-loaded
- No route-based splitting (though single page app)

#### 4. **Memory Management** (LOW IMPACT)
- Good use of AbortController for cleanup
- useEffect cleanup properly implemented
- Some useMemo usage but could be expanded

### Recommended Optimizations:

#### Priority 1 (Immediate Impact):
1. Add React.memo to service card components
2. Optimize image assets (compress PNG)
3. Add lazy loading for modals/panels

#### Priority 2 (Medium Impact):
1. Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
2. Add service worker for API caching
3. Optimize CSS with critical path extraction

#### Priority 3 (Long-term):
1. Consider React Query for API state management
2. Implement intersection observer for card visibility
3. Add progressive loading for non-critical features

### Performance Metrics to Monitor:
- Bundle size trends
- Memory usage over time
- API request frequency
- Component render counts
- Time to interactive

### Implementation Notes:
- Current architecture is well-structured for optimization
- Vite's built-in optimizations are working well
- Good separation of concerns makes selective optimization possible
